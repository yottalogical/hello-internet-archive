## FAQ

### What's the point of this?

Squarespace, the hosting service used by Hello Internet has made the dumb decision to limit the number of episodes to 100. This means that any episode of a podcast hosted on Squarespace besides the 100 most recent ones will not be visible to podcast clients.

To be clear, the old episodes of Hello Internet still exist, and can still be listened to. It's just that clients can't see them any more, because they aren't on the RSS feed. For those who don't know, an RSS feed is basically a list that tells the client about each episode.

The _Hello Internet Archive_ is a project to make a separate RSS feed that contains all the episodes that have been lost to the crushing foot of Squarespace's 100 episode limit.

### Wait, isn't that freebooting?

Nope!

None of the episodes on this RSS feed have been rehosted. When you download each episode, the audio file still comes from the official servers of Hello Internet.

This is just like as if I had made a website with a link to each of the old episodes, except that the whole process is automated.

Brady and Grey are definitely okay with you listening to the old episodes, otherwise they wouldn't still have them up on [the website](https://hellointernet.fm), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/HelloInternetPodcast), [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/hellointernet), and [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/itunes811377230/hello-internet), not to mention they certainly wouldn't be actively campaigning for [#SquarespaceBeyond100](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SquareSpaceBeyond100).

### Why not also have the newer episodes?

I've made the intentional decision not to include the newer episodes in the _Hello Internet Archive_.

The main reason is that the official Hello Internet podcast still gets benefit from having people subscribe to it directly. Some clients will promote podcasts with a large number of listeners. If people left the official version of the podcast for the _Hello Internet Archive_, that would slow growth.

Another reason is that I have to manually put in new episodes by hand. It might be a few days before I realize a new episode has been released, or weeks if I'm traveling and/or busy. This would make for a terrible user experience.

If you want to fork this repo and make a version with every single episode, have at it!
